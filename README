# Employee Management System

## Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a console-based Java application developed to manage employee records efficiently.  
It provides functionality to add, view, search, update, and delete employee information.  
The system uses Java Collections and File Handling to ensure data persistence and fast access.

---

## Objectives
- To implement CRUD operations using Java
- To store employee data using ArrayList and HashMap
- To provide fast employee lookup by employee ID
- To save and load employee data using file handling
- To generate salary and department-wise reports
- To apply exception handling for reliable execution
